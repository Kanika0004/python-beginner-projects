# Beginner Python Projects 🚀

This repository contains **14 beginner-friendly Python projects** that I built while learning Python through hands-on practice.

The goal of these projects was to strengthen my understanding of Python fundamentals by actively building small programs instead of focusing only on theory.

## 🧠 What I Learned

Through these projects, I developed a strong foundation in:
- Python syntax and core programming concepts
- Control flow (loops, conditionals)
- Functions and modular programming
- Handling user input and basic validation
- Logical thinking and problem-solving
- Debugging and improving code readability
